# X (Twitter) Content Strategy — YOUR_X_HANDLE

## Posting Rules (CRITICAL)
- NEVER post without Alex's approval — send drafts to Discord first
- If bird CLI fails, provide exact copy text for Alex to paste manually
- No generic commentary, no "zero value" posts
- Every post must give actionable value or a unique insight
- No hashtags, no engagement bait, no sycophantic tone
- Direct, technical, practical — match Alex's voice

## Voice & Tone
- First person, conversational but knowledgeable
- Hot takes welcome — have opinions
- Specifics > generalities (numbers, names, links)
- Problem → insight structure
- Short punchy sentences. No fluff.

## Content Pillars
1. **AI Agents & Infrastructure** — Moltbot/Clawdbot ecosystem, Cloudflare, deployment
2. **Building in Public** — what we're shipping, lessons learned
3. **Security & Privacy** — AI agent risks, best practices, incidents
4. **Developer Tools** — frameworks, APIs, workflows that matter

## X Algorithm Cheat Sheet (2026)
- Replies weigh **14x more than likes** — conversation starters win
- Grok-powered semantic ranking — niche content gets fair discovery
- Premium accounts get **4x visibility** (in-network), **2x** (out-of-network)
- First 30 min engagement determines reach
- Long-form tweets now rewarded OVER threads
- Dwell time (how long people read) = strong signal
- Images/video outperform plain text
- 66% of tweets come from automated accounts

## Posting Cadence
- **8 AM ET** — Morning post (overnight news reaction)
- **12 PM ET** — Engagement round (reply to 3-5 niche tweets)
- **5 PM ET** — Evening post (research-backed, longer form) + engagement round
- **Every 2h (8AM-10PM)** — Trend scan, draft reactive content if something breaks

## Engagement-First Strategy
Before posting original content:
1. Find 5-10 high-engagement tweets in our niche
2. Reply with genuine value (insight, data, experience)
3. Target accounts with 1k-50k followers (sweet spot for network building)
4. THEN post our content when we're already active in conversations

## Post Formats
- **Hot Take** (280 chars): News reaction, opinion, observation
- **Long-Form** (1000-2500 chars): Deep analysis, technical breakdown, data-backed insight
- **Quote Tweet**: Viral tweet + our unique angle
- **News + Link**: Breaking story + one-line insight + URL

## Posting Methods (Priority Order)
1. **Bird CLI** — `bird tweet "text"` (cookie auth, no API costs, daily limits apply)
2. **Manual paste** — I draft, Alex copies and posts (fallback when bird is rate-limited)
3. **X API** — needs payment method on console.x.com PPU plan (currently blocked)
4. **baoyu-post-to-x** — browser automation via Chrome CDP (for quote tweets, media)

## What NOT to Post
- Generic "AI is changing everything" takes
- Obvious observations anyone could make
- Anything without a specific number, name, or link
- Threads (algorithm now prefers long-form single tweets)
- Anything that sounds like a press release

## Metrics to Track
- Impressions per post
- Reply rate (most important signal)
- Profile visits from posts
- Follower growth rate
- Which content pillars perform best
