# Image Spec — X & LinkedIn Content

All cover images and post visuals for X and LinkedIn must follow this spec.

## Style: Handwritten "letters" inspired

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Monochromatic palette:** Black, white, and grayscale only. No color. Creates a serious, timeless, intellectual tone.
- **High contrast:** Stark backgrounds, white text, pale image backgrounds. Dramatic and focused.
- **Minimalist layout:** Clean, plenty of negative space, sans-serif typography. Readability and impact over decoration.

### Illustration Style
- **Surreal/metaphorical symbolism:** Every image is a conceptual illustration, not literal. Single strong metaphor per image.
- **Common motifs:** Human figures in contemplative/precarious situations, brain/mind imagery, choice/illusion themes, isolation, momentum, risk.
- **Fine-line sketch style:** Looks like ink drawings or pencil sketches — detailed line work, hatching for shading, soft textures. Digital illustration with classic editorial feel (think New Yorker style or philosophical book covers).
- **Surrealist influence:** Echoes of Magritte, Escher, Dalí — dreamlike, impossible scenarios stripped to minimalist symbolism.
- **Centered composition:** Subjects centered, symmetrical, isolated against empty space. Eye goes immediately to the core metaphor.

### The Recipe
1. Grayscale surreal illustration
2. Single strong metaphorical symbol
3. Fine-line sketch style
4. Centered composition on pale background
5. Paired with bold white text on black (when text overlay needed)

### Purpose
Each image acts as a visual hook that instantly communicates the article/post's core idea. The uniformity creates instant brand recognition — viewers know it's @yourhandle content at a glance.
