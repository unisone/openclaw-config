# Posting Framework — X + LinkedIn

## The Rule: Research → Draft → Test → Measure → Iterate

Nothing gets posted on vibes. Every decision is backed by data or being A/B tested to get data.

## Pre-Post Checklist (Every Post)

### 1. Research Phase
- [ ] Search X/LinkedIn for top-performing posts on the same topic
- [ ] Identify what format they used (text-only, image, carousel, thread)
- [ ] Note their hook style, length, structure
- [ ] Check: is this topic trending right now? (timing matters)

### 2. Draft Phase
- [ ] Follow platform-specific format (see below)
- [ ] Include specific tool names, numbers, real examples (no generic advice)
- [ ] Apply the "Swiffer test" — would someone learn something copy-paste actionable?
- [ ] Visual: what image/screenshot/diagram stops the scroll?

### 3. Review Phase (MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS)
- [ ] Draft posted to Discord #content for the owner's approval
- [ ] This includes ALL public actions: posts, comments, replies, edits
- [ ] WAIT for explicit "yes" / "ship it" / approval before executing
- [ ] Never assume approval — even if the owner says "post it", show final text first
- [ ] Check against "What NOT to Post" list
- [ ] Read it aloud — does it sound like a person or a press release?

### 4. Post Phase
- [ ] Post at optimal time for platform
- [ ] Tag relevant accounts if natural (not forced)
- [ ] Reply to all comments within 15 min

### 5. Measure Phase (24h + 7d)
- [ ] Log metrics to Notion Content Calendar
- [ ] Compare against previous posts (same format? different format?)
- [ ] Note what worked/didn't in daily memory file

## A/B Testing System

### How We Test
Every post is tagged with format variables in Notion:
- **Hook style:** Contrarian / Data-lead / Story / Question / News-reaction
- **Format:** Text-only / Text+Image / Thread / Carousel (LinkedIn)
- **Length:** Short (<280) / Medium (280-1000) / Long (1000+)
- **CTA type:** Question / None / Implied
- **Topic pillar:** AI Agents / Building in Public / Security / Dev Tools
- **Time posted:** Morning / Midday / Evening

### What We're Testing First (Weeks 1-2)
Round 1 — Hook styles:
- Post A: Contrarian hook ("Cisco called it a nightmare...")
- Post B: Data-lead hook ("AI changed how I work...")
- Post C: Story hook ("While I slept, my agent shipped a PR...")

Round 2 — Format (once we know winning hook style):
- Post A: Text-only
- Post B: Text + screenshot
- Post C: Text + diagram/architecture visual

Round 3 — Length:
- Compare engagement rates across short/medium/long

### Success Metrics (Priority Order)
**X:** Replies > Retweets > Bookmarks > Profile visits > Likes > Impressions
**LinkedIn:** Comments > Shares > Profile visits > Reactions > Impressions

(Matches algorithm weights — replies/comments are worth 10-20x likes on both platforms)

## Platform Formats

### X Format
- **Voice:** Sharp, opinionated, technical. No fluff. No emojis.
- **Hook:** 47-73 chars, specific number or contrarian claim
- **Body:** Real tool names, real numbers, copy-paste actionable
- **Visual:** Screenshot, terminal output, architecture diagram. No stock images.
- **CTA:** Question that invites experience (30% of posts). Rest: strong closing statement.
- **Length:** Long-form single posts or threads (both perform well with Premium)
- **Links:** Never in main body. Reply if essential, but even that barely drives traffic.
- **Strategy:** Build reputation with builders/devs. No self-promotion. Let work speak.

### LinkedIn Format
- **Voice:** Narrative, storytelling, professional but personal
- **Hook:** Bold claim or surprising result in first 2 lines (must earn the "see more" click)
- **Body:** Timeline structure works ("While I slept..." / "Before lunch...")
- **Tool names:** Always include — keyword SEO + credibility
- **Visual:** Carousel/PDF performs best, then image, then text-only
- **CTA:** Question at end. Always.
- **Strategy:** Show don't sell. Demonstrate capability through real examples. Never pitch. Leads come inbound.
- **No hashtags** (TBD — pending research data)

## Content Calendar Rhythm

### X (Daily)
- 1 original post per day (quality > quantity while growing)
- 3 replies to bigger accounts per original post (3:1 ratio)
- Reply to ALL comments on own posts within 15 min
- Self-quote-tweet best performers at 4-6h mark

### LinkedIn (3x/week)
- Mon / Wed / Fri mornings
- Each post A/B tests one variable
- Cross-post adapted versions only when format fits (never copy-paste between platforms)

---

## Review Cadence
- **Weekly (Sunday):** Review all metrics from the week, update what's working
- **Bi-weekly:** Adjust strategy based on A/B test results
- **Monthly:** Full strategy review — what to double down on, what to drop

*This framework evolves. Update it with every learning.*
