# Knowledge Base Index

This directory is meant to become your **searchable, reusable** operational knowledge.

Rule of thumb:
- Something happened today → `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Reference you’ll reuse → `knowledge/`

## Categories

- `tools/` — CLI/tool setup, quirks, flags
- `apis/` — API setup, rate limits, gotchas (store secrets elsewhere)
- `workflows/` — repeatable runbooks
- `decisions/` — why you chose X over Y (ADRs)
- `troubleshooting/` — known bugs + fixes
- `vendor-info/` — non-secret account notes, support contacts
- `processes/` — team conventions

Add links here as you create entries.
