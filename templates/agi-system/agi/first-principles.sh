=== FIRST PRINCIPLES DECOMPOSITION ===

## Step 1: State the Problem Clearly
What are we actually trying to solve?
- [Write it in one sentence]

## Step 2: Identify Assumptions
What are we taking for granted?
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Step 3: Break Down to Fundamentals
What are the irreducible truths here?
- Physics constraints:
- Economic constraints:
- Technical constraints:
- Human constraints:

## Step 4: Question Each Assumption
For each assumption above:
- Is this actually true?
- Why do we believe this?
- What if it wasn't true?

## Step 5: Rebuild from Atoms
Starting ONLY from fundamental truths:
- What's the simplest possible solution?
- What would we build if we had no legacy?
- What does physics/economics actually require?

## Step 6: Compare to Convention
- How does our rebuilt solution differ from convention?
- What's the delta?
- Is the conventional approach justified or just inherited?

## Output
- **Fundamental truth:** [core insight]
- **Unconventional path:** [what we'd do differently]
- **Confidence:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- **Risk of being wrong:** [what we might be missing]
