# Self-Review — Recent Lessons to Remember

*Updated by AGI learning cycle. Read this on session start.*

## 🔴 CRITICAL (Check before every response)

1. **Verify before claiming** — If you haven't checked, say so
2. **Research-first** — Never recommend without evidence
3. **Memory search** — Always search before answering "remember when..."
4. **Approval gate** — ALL public actions require explicit "yes"

## 🟡 RECENT MISSES (Last 7 days)

- 2026-02-03: Half-assed research — ran quick search, presented as comprehensive
- 2026-01-31: Premature recommendation — suggested MCP without any evidence
- 2026-01-28: Generic LinkedIn posts rejected as "zero value"

## 🟢 RECENT WINS (Patterns to repeat)

- Contract-first multi-agent coordination worked well
- Diagnosis Protocol saved time (check config before recommending workarounds)
- Sub-agent spawning for context-heavy tasks
